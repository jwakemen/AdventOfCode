# Advent of Code

[https://adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com)

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles.

## Notes

* The 2022 solutions were done as a warmup for the 2023 event. They are not complete. I did a handful to get familiar with the process.
* 2023 Solutions are in Python3. I'm using Python 3.10.13.
* So far everything for the year is just dumped into the same directory. Inputs and solutions are numbered based on the day of the puzzle.
* There have been two related puzzles per day they are numbered xx.1 and xx.2. They have shared the same input file so far.
